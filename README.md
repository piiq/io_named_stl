# io_named_stl

## Named STL export add-on for Blender

⚠️ This add-on is work in progress. Refer to the `develop` branch for the latest version.

An export add-on for Blender 2.8, which exports selected objects **with names** to an ASCII STL file.
These names are required to get a suitable stl for using in snappyHexMesh.
